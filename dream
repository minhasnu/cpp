I had a dream today. I was at a petrol station staring into my burning car and there is a narration 
goin on inside my head which was not mine. she said that a sane man who thinks about the future or 
someone who cares about the future wouldnt smoke.

I decided to jump on the guy next to me, steal his car and flee the scene. It didnt go so well even 
then i end up fighting with the guy and i choke him in the midst of all this chaos. Then she says ,
"you just coudn't run away huh!"

dream 2
i was choking a guy to death and my entire dream becomes a youtube ad and den i wake up. heheh!
